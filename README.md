# Remote-job-control-shell




Feature:

   1. execute programs in the remote shell (executable program like command 'ls')
   
   2. change directory in the remote shell (the built-in command 'cd') using both absolute path and relative path.
     The feature is implemented mainly with a variable in client, holding the filepath of the remote machine.
      
   3. check if input filepath is valid (using File exist()), invert the change of filepath if invalid
   
   4. enable file/directory compress and transfer through network
   
   5. refactor the message through network using polymorphism
   
   6. commands are transfered using sockets
